Why Your Canon Printer May Not Be Connecting
--------------------------------------------

Before jumping into fixes, it helps to know what could be causing the problem. Common reasons include:

- **Loose or Faulty USB Cables:**
A damaged or improperly connected cable can prevent communication between your computer and printer.

- **Unstable or Mismatched Wi-Fi Connections:**
For wireless printers, both the printer and computer must be on the same Wi-Fi network for proper connectivity.

- **Outdated or Missing Printer Drivers:**
Old or corrupt drivers may stop your computer from recognizing the printer.

- **Incorrect Printer Settings:**
If the printer is set to offline, paused, or isn’t the default printer, your computer might not send print jobs correctly.

- **Stuck Print Jobs:**
A jammed print queue can prevent new documents from printing.

- **Temporary Software Glitches:**
System or printer software issues can occasionally block connections.
